# Real Estate Home Price Prediction Project

Welcome to my GitHub repository featuring a comprehensive project on real estate home price predictions. In this project, I applied machine learning techniques to analyze and predict home prices based on various features. This initiative was driven by the aim to provide valuable insights to both homebuyers and sellers in the dynamic real estate market.

### Key Features of the Project:

## 1.Dataset Selection and Exploration:

I download the data set from the kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data)
I curated a robust dataset comprising a diverse range of real estate features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and more.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the distribution and relationships among different variables.
## 2.Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values, outliers, and performed feature engineering to enhance the dataset's quality.
Utilized techniques such as one-hot encoding and normalization to prepare the data for machine learning models.
## 3.Model Selection:

Explored various regression models, including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods, to identify the most suitable model for predicting home prices.
Conducted hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
## 4.Model Evaluation:

Employed metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to assess the accuracy and reliability of the models.
Visualized model predictions against actual prices for a comprehensive understanding of performance.
## 5.Deployment:

Considered potential deployment strategies, including model deployment through cloud platforms or integration into a web application.
Technologies Used:

Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Jupyter Notebooks
Results:
The project resulted in accurate and reliable home price predictions, providing stakeholders with valuable insights into the factors influencing real estate prices. The model's performance was validated through thorough testing and evaluation.
